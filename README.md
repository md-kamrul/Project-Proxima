# Proxima: A Gaming Learning Platform with AI

## HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY
The **Proxima** project, developed by Team CryptoHattori, is an interactive web-based educational platform aimed at making exoplanet science accessible and engaging, especially for underserved communities. It offers a gamified learning experience where students can explore distant exoplanets like astronauts or wander through a planetary museum, fostering curiosity and excitement for space exploration. The platform integrates artificial intelligence for personalized learning, quizzes, and access to organized and reliable resources, creating an all-in-one learning environment. By leveraging advanced game development tools and NASA resources, "Proxima" seeks to inspire the next generation of space enthusiasts and make complex exoplanet science more approachable for students.
