# Proxima: A Gaming Learning Platform with AI

## HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY
The **Proxima** project, developed by Team CryptoHattori, is an interactive web-based educational platform aimed at making exoplanet science accessible and engaging, especially for underserved communities. It offers a gamified learning experience where students can explore distant exoplanets like astronauts or wander through a planetary museum, fostering curiosity and excitement for space exploration. The platform integrates artificial intelligence for personalized learning, quizzes, and access to organized and reliable resources, creating an all-in-one learning environment. By leveraging advanced game development tools and NASA resources, "Proxima" seeks to inspire the next generation of space enthusiasts and make complex exoplanet science more approachable for students.

## DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Our project was driven by a passion for making exoplanet education accessible and engaging for students through a gamified learning experience. In Exodiscover, players can explore a virtual museum filled with detailed information about exoplanets and then embark on a space journey where they must follow the correct path to reach their chosen exoplanet. Along the way, interactive quizzes test their knowledge, offering hints and advantages for correct answers, while wrong choices lead to game-over scenarios. If players successfully navigate through the orbit and reach the exoplanet, they complete the game.

## HOW IT WORKS
Here’s an overview of our system architecture. We are maintaining a secure system for protecting user data on this system. We are working on an interactive gaming system to make the learning process more engaging. We have used the Unity game Engine to build an interactive gaming-based learning platform. The system includes user-friendly interfaces for web applications, ensuring users can easily access and interact with the system. `We are using the NASA Website and API to provide authentic information.`

### The Game:

We have made the game as immersive as possible. The game is designed so that learners can enjoy it while learning, boosting engagement and retention. 

The game starts in a classroom where the player puts on a VR headset that takes him to the ISS (International Space Station)

![image2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e34e952-f96e-4a0d-ab36-1c7b4b155657)

Players can view the 3D models of the exoplanets in the museum inside the ISS. They can take a spaceship and visit those planets that are **Landable**.
